>       While amplification/attenuation commute (mulplication of
       scaling factors), clamping operations do not. The order
       in which various gain related operations are applied is:
       Distance attenuation is calculated first, including 
       minimum (REFERENCE_DISTANCE) and maximum (MAX_DISTANCE)
       thresholds. If the Source is directional (CONE_INNER_ANGLE 
       less than CONE_OUTER_ANGLE), an angle-dependent attenuation
       is calculated depending on CONE_OUTER_GAIN, and multiplied
       with the distance dependent attenuation.
       The resulting attenuation factor for the given angle and
       distance between Listener and Source is multiplied
       with Source GAIN. The effective GAIN computed this way
       is compared against MIN_GAIN and MAX_GAIN thresholds.
       The result is guaranteed to be clamped to [MIN_GAIN, MAX_GAIN],
       and subsequently multiplied by Listener GAIN which serves
       as an overall volume control. The implementation is free
       to clamp Listener GAIN if necessary due to hardware or
       implementation constraints.
