>      By default, AL uses seconds and Hertz as units for
      time and frequency, respectively.
      A float or integral value of one 
      for a variable that specifies quantities like duration, 
      latency, delay, or any other parameter measured as time,
      specifies 1 second.
      For frequency, the basic unit is 1/second, or Hertz.
      In other words, sample frequencies and frequency
      cut-offs or filter parameters specifying frequencies
      are expressed in units of Hertz.

        Will time be an AL state that can be queried and scaled?
        AL usually (always) implements a real-time 
         process with the constraint that it has to be 
         synchronized with the time as experienced by the user.
         Do the units used with respect to time and frequency have
        a fixed meaning?

         Given a frequency range from a few Hz to 50kHz or more,
         we need a temporal resolution of 20 microseconds or less.
         For simplicity that means we either resolve Milliseconds
         and loose precision, or we resolve microseconds.  
        Applications might run hours or days, which is 10E5 seconds
        or more. If we cover 12 orders of magnitude (10E6 to 10E-6)
        32bit unsigned integer will not suffice. Do we introduce
        a 64 signed integer for the purpose of specifying time
        over a duration of several days at microseconds resolution,
        or do we use two 32bit integers, and how do we split them?

>        Duration can be queried in microsecond resolution in 
        case we want to account for O(10Khz) sampling
        frequencies properly, or milliseconds if we 
        do not anticipate the need to go beyond typical 
        operating system time resolution.

>        We need query as double, float, and possibly 
        long (as of now an undefined data type).
        We might need an INVALID_RANGE error on the getter,
        especially if large reptition counters can be set.
        For paused source, the remainder will be the same
        as for playing sources. The application can query
        the Source State to find out the additional
        information. INFINITE is not needed,
        no is UNKNOWN as we operate on known
        queues.
