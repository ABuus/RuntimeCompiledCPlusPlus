>    To the programmer, OpenAL is a set of commands that allow the
    specification of sound sources and a listener in three
    dimensions, combined with commands that control how these
    sound sources are rendered into the output buffer. The
    effect of OpenAL commands is not guaranteed to be immediate,
    as there are latencies depending on the implementation,
    but ideally such latency should not be noticeable to the
    user.
    </P
><P
>    A typical program that uses OpenAL begins with calls to 
    open a sound device which is used to process output and
    play it on attached hardware (e.g. speakers or headphones).
    Then, calls are made to allocate an AL context and
    associate it with the device. Once an AL context is
    allocated, the programmer is free to issue AL commands.
    Some calls are used to render Sources (point and directional
    Sources, looping or not), while others affect the rendering
    of these Sources including how they are attenuated by
    distance and relative orientation.

>       Often, OpenAL will be used to render a 3D audio environment 
       matched by a 3D visual scenery. For this purpose, OpenAL is 
       meant to be a seamlessly integrating complement to OpenGL.
       OpenAL state can be updated in sync with the OpenGL or video
       updates (synchronized), or in timesteps independent of the 
       graphics framerate. Audio rendering loops usually update 
       the current locations of the sources and the listener, updates 
       global settings, and manages buffers.
