         MikeV suggests: an application can query the amount of memory buffer 
         is consuming. He suggests using GetBufferi(AL_SIZE, ... ). This seems
         a bad idea as (a) the application is not meant to micromanage
         driver-internal memory, (b) the memory requirements known to the
         application might differ from the actual, (c) there are OS
         mechanisms to query free memory, (d) AL_SIZE is now ambiguous as
         it announces app-side memory as allocated vs. driver side memory
         as used by the driver. For clarity AL_INTERNAL_SIZE (analog to
         internal format enums) might be a better choice.

       The Buffer state is dependent on the state of all Sources
       that is has been queued for.  
       A single queue occurrence of a Buffer propagates the
       Buffer state (over all Sources) from UNUSED to PROCESSED
       or higher. Sources that are STOPPED or INITIAL still have 
       queue entries that cause Buffers to be PROCESSED. 
   </P
><P
>       A single queue entry
       with a single Source for which the Buffer is not yet
       PROCESSED propagates the buffer's queueing state to 
       PENDING.
   </P
><P
>       Buffers that are PROCESSED for a given Source can be 
       unqueued from that Source's queue. Buffers that have
       been unqueued from all Sources are UNUSED.
       Buffers that are UNUSED can be deleted, or changed by 
       BufferData commands.

         However, the application has to check whether the
         Buffer is still in use by other Sources. For now,
         applications have to maintain their own lists of
         buffer consumer (source) lists. If necessary, an

         with respect to all Sources might be added in

     The error on using BufferData in QUEUED buffers is introduced 
     because the implementation might not be able to guarantee when 
     the Buffer is dereferenced. Applications have to account for the 
     possibility that the Buffer is dereferenced at the latest possible 
     moment, e.g. when it becomes CURRENT. As it is easier to relax
     this restricition at a later time (no effect on backwards
     compatibility) than doing the reverse, we are conserative here.
